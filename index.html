    	<p> Ayurveda is considered the sister-science of yoga and was created over 5,000 years ago. It is based on the philosophy that everything is made of the elements water, earth, fire, air, and ether. All of these balance each other out, and imbalance creates disease. </p>
      <br>
    <p class="block"> There are three constitutions (doshas) that make up everything, including people. They are Vata, Kapha, and Pitta. They are represented by air/ether, water/earth, and fire/water, respectively. 
      </p>
  <br>
  Every person has all three constitutions, but often there is a dominant one and a secondary one. For example, a person may be primarily a Kapha (water/earth) constitution, which means they have more characteristics of a Kapha than the other two doshas. They can have a secondary dosha as well, meaning that the Kapha-dominant person could also have strong traits of a Vata (air/ether) person. This constitution would be called Kapha-Vata.

  The elements of Kapha are water and earth (think of mud). The qualities are oily, moist, cold, and heavy. Kapha people are usually of a larger build, with a tendency to carry extra weight. If they are in shape, they build muscle very easily. They retain water and have thick, pale skin. Their hair is thick and full of luster, and they have round, loving eyes. 
  Their personalities when in balance can be extremely caring, supportive, and forgiving. When out of balance they can be jealous, dull or depressed, and greedy.
