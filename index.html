	<p> Ayurveda is considered the sister-science of yoga and was created over 5,000 years ago. It is based on the philosophy that everything is made of the elements water, earth, fire, air, and ether. All of these balance each other out, and imbalance creates disease. </p>
  <p> There are three constitutions that make up everything, including people. They are Vata, Kapha, and Pitta. They are represented by air/ether, water/earth, and fire/water, respectively.
